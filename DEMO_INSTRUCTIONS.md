# üé¨ Demo Instructions for Visual Understanding Chat Assistant

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Setup Environment

1. Open a terminal in the project directory:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\CascadeProjects\visual-chat-assistant
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
python setup.py
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Configure OpenAI API Key

1. Open the `.env` file
2. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO: Starting server on 0.0.0.0:8000
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Step 4: Access the Web Interface

## üìπ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Traffic Video Analysis

1. **Upload a traffic scene video** (dashcam footage, intersection recording, etc.)
2. Click **"Analyze Video"**
3. The system will:
   - Identify vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights
   - Detect violations (running red lights, jaywalking, etc.)

4. **Example chat queries:**
   - "What traffic violations were detected?"
   - "Describe the pedestrian activity at 30 seconds"
   - "Were there any dangerous situations?"
   - "How many vehicles ran the red light?"

### Scenario 2: Safety Compliance Video

1. **Upload a workplace or construction site video**
2. The system will identify:
   - PPE compliance (helmets, safety vests)
   - Unsafe behaviors
   - Equipment handling violations

3. **Example chat queries:**
   - "Are all workers wearing proper safety equipment?"
   - "What safety violations occurred?"
   - "Describe the events between 10-20 seconds"

### Scenario 3: General Activity Recognition

1. **Upload any video with human activities**
2. The system will:
   - Recognize various activities
   - Track object interactions
   - Create a timeline of events

3. **Example chat queries:**
   - "What are people doing in this video?"
   - "When did the main event occur?"
   - "Summarize all activities chronologically"

   - No attribution required
   - Various scenarios

3. **YouTube** (download with permission)
   - Traffic compilation videos
   - Safety training videos
   - Security camera footage

### Recommended Test Scenarios

1. **Traffic intersection** - Shows vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights
2. **Construction site** - Safety compliance checking
3. **Retail store** - Customer behavior analysis
4. **Sports activity** - Event sequence detection
5. **Security footage** - Anomaly detection

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "OpenAI API key not found"**
- Ensure `.env` file exists
- Check API key is correctly set
- Restart the application

**2. "Video processing failed"**
- Check video format (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM)
- Ensure video is under 2 minutes
- Try a smaller resolution video

**3. "Cannot connect to server"**
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Try running on a different port: `PORT=8080 python main.py`
- Check firewall settings

**4. "Module not found" errors**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Check Python version (3.8+)

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **For faster processing:**
   - Use videos under 1 minute initially
   - Lower resolution videos (720p or less)
   - Ensure good internet connection (for API calls)

2. **For better results:**
   - Use clear, well-lit videos
   - Avoid shaky footage
   - Include relevant scenarios for guideline checking
